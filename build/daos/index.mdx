# Starry Networks

> “We need to be building cultures before structures” -- Ruth Catlow

> “As a guiding star, web3 applications could aim to introduce value in relations which have been historically denied it, such as labor and the environment, rather than creating new financialized relations.” -- Kei Kreutler

> “If we schematize the world as a ledger, what happens to us, our relations, how we feel and exist? If we schematize the world as organized by cosmic resonances, as in classical east asian philosophy, what happens? If we schematize the world as waves, which encode messages and may be heard and read, what kinds of poetry would we hear from the vibration of objects?” -- Kelsey Chen

This build guild is intended as a deep dive into a future where we co-develop open tools for more valuable collaboration. In order to do that, we'll start by going all the way back to the beginning of cooperatives and beyond. Everyone is welcome to join this first conversational session, which will introduce the above and explore the possibilities for culture in The Guilded Age. 

We'll then spend a lot of time thinking about pattern languages for wholesome organisation and wise decision making, all of which are being collected on the  [Zodiac wiki](https://zodiac.wiki) (and some of which are being discovered through the open source Zodiac tools). Most importantly, we'd love for those who participate in the DAOs & Dragons to help teach at least one other person what you learn here. 

**Each one teach one** is our motto in these parts. Or, as Kei Kreutler aptly puts it, we aim for [rough consensus and running worlds](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GzwFAxMhCwC4GBiTNPDujL-MGeEjT2vTlkEoz_6KB5k/edit?usp=sharing). This is how p2p learning propagates.
