# Session I

While networks have existed throughout history, new information technology emphasizes cooperative relations that greatly impact institutions, by cutting across jurisdictions and through markets. In this session, we'll be looking at the 19th Century roots of cooperativism, relating that to various different historical developments online and then looking to different kinds of guilds and the informal economic systems they have established in order to navigate the needs of human beings living, working and playing together in a networked world.

Next week, we'll beginning looking at 'pattern languages' for DAOs, based on the insight that - in order to contextualise the randomly accessed collective memory of collective organisations - we need a shared language and some common knowledge. “We are each other's environment” and we look forward to participating with you as we investigate together new cultural models for more connected relationships.
