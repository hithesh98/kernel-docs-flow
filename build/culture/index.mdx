# Cultured conversations

After the roaring success of [nfteasy](/build/nfteasy), we decided to take a step back and consider NFTs and culture in crypto from a broader and less technical lense. Previous fellows Ben Percifeld and Yulia Babnova graciously agreed to host the first guild in KB5 and you can find recordings of all the insightful and humourous sessions they held below. After they did so, Sparrow Read brought her unique perspective and artistic experience to the mix during KB7, which you can also explore below.

## Preparation

- [A poetics of permanent transformation](https://outland.art/rhea-myers/)
- [The one Miro board to rule them all](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOLwz2ic=/)
- [The best virtual worlds are imagined, not simulated.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2xTl5pPHwk)

From the first link above, we run straight into the kind of contradictions which, when held honestly and with humble grace, can remake a culture:

"_Titled_ sits in the contradiction at the heart of the entire concept of NFTs: we perform ownership of things that cannot be possessed [...] For Myers, there is no outside. There is no safe, neutral position from which to assess art, technology, capital, or anything else [...] A lot of art exists, according to Myers, simply to assuage the anxiety of liberals who can decode reassuring symbols then go merrily on their way without ever confronting their entanglement in systems they claim to oppose. The transparency and pragmatism of the blockchain, if taken to its logical conclusion, is something that could genuinely threaten this way of being."
