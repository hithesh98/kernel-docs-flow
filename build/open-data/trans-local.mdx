# Trans-Local

In this guild session, we host an active and largely unstructured discussion about bridging the wholesome application of these global tools and networks with local benefit, primarily through the lens of education. 

Richie Laburn and [Boyd Varty](https://boydvarty.com/) joined us to present [Index Africa](https://indexafrica.io/). They run the only Indexer in Africa and are aiming to use the profits from this to sponsor a [big educational program](https://graphrica.org/) they run just outside the Kruger National Park in South Africa. Their idea is to create a virtuous loop where local people both benefit from, while learning about, dweb tools in ways which are contextually relevant and which also expand the possible uses of such tools [via more creative story-telling and shared listening](https://leopardsnft.xyz/).

Eva, Richie, Boyd and Andy engage in a discussion, much like any Kernel fireside. Our intention is to paint fully the conceptual picture of pleasing gifts that open our time together into more valuable collaborations which are centered on awareness of the environment and deep appreciation of local context. We look together at the tracks and traces of our lives which imbue them with meaning and a sense of something greater in order to understand the "why" of open data: why does all of this stuff really matter so much, and why should we care?
