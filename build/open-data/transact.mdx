# Trans-Act

> “A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.” ― Frank Herbert

In order to understand what **interdependent transfer mechanisms** may look like, let's take a few steps backwards and begin with the tool that is most likely to be familiar to any data scientist: [Dune](https://dune.com/). The fact that so much financial data is already available in one place, which can be freely queried by anyone, and in which we can all build upon and learn from each other's queries and dashboards, is incredibly significant in and of itself. We must first understand this phase change before diving into deeper thoughts about what new and different kinds of tokens might mean for the sorts of facts we can agree upon and the kind of shared truths such values can finance. As the developers at Dune write:

> We’ve made access to this data easily readable and coupled it with a powerful analytics tool, all directly accessible for free on our website. This means that anyone can look at human readable data from the blockchain and turn it into dashboards with informative charts in a matter of minutes.

## Open Plan

1. We begin by clicking through Dune to look at various ways of finding good dashboards and interesting data. We will also consider how 'open' this open data really is.
2. We then look in greater detail at [this Gitcoin dashboard](https://dune.com/gm365/gitcoin).
3. We consider the data that is there, do some interpretation, and then consider what is missing.
4. We craft a new query step by step, which should end up looking something like [this](https://dune.com/queries/1318905).
5. We show how to submit your own contracts to be indexed by Dune and take [Signature Economies](https://sign.kernel.community) as an example.
6. We discuss [data at MakerDAO](https://data.makerdao.network/), it's differnt dynamics, the importance and representation and inventive interfaces, and the ethical requirements of working with open data.
7. If you'd like to get involved in the wider discussion in the ecosystem, consider participating [here](https://metricsdao.notion.site/web3-Data-Glossary-750546b7d18447f39ac145f8e9532f4f).
