# Citta

The terms "citta" and "dhamma", which form the last two pillars are a little more difficult to translate than body, breath, or feeling. "Citta" means something more like heart-mind: it is certainly not just an intellectual sense, but one that is - as always - embodied, incarnate, spirited.

We offer here three different guided sessions on various aspects of _citta_.
