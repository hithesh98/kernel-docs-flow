# Shared Wisdom - Everipedia

Selected as the first guild for KB7, the outcome of our conversation about Everipedia was not particularly positive, illustrating that not all of the tokens this guild considers are necessarily well thought-out and clearly designed.

One comment in particular seemed to capture the vibe of the group: "It could be an interesting machine to study… if only to understand why it didn’t do what it set out to do". We feel that we can learn just as much (sometimes more!) by looking at token experiments which don't work, as we can by considering models that seem to be living up to their stated design goals.

## Preparation

2. Read [the hype](https://cointelegraph.com/news/everipedia-iq-rallies-400-after-an-nft-collaboration-with-the-associated-press)
3. Read [the issues](https://theoutline.com/post/2369/everipedia-is-the-wikipedia-for-being-wrong?zd=1&zi=76c4k5rf)
