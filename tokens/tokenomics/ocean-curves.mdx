# Ocean Protocol

In this discussion, we take a look at the Ocean Protocol - an open market for data. We begin by considering the "web3 sustainability loop" and then move into more speculative territory as we try to tease apart use cases, the various changes made to the token model over the years by the core team, whether anyone has actually earned money from data or other interactions in the marketplace, and what all this has to do with vote escrowed tokens.

## Preparation
